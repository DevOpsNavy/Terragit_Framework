# Terragit_Framework

## Overview

This repository presents a framework for terraform based CI/CD pipelines. Several exercises are provided to demonstrate the decisions made when designing the framework.

### Stage 1

Stage 1 explores the high level decision of how to handle environments within the framework.

The following exercises are provided:

1. Exercise 1 - demonstrates how utilising traditional feature branches with terraform is not possible without a CICD pipeline.
2. Exercise 2 - demonstrates how feature branches can still be with terraform once utilising a CICD pipeline.
3. Exercise 3 - demonstrates a new paradigm of feature environments for terraform based CI/CD.
